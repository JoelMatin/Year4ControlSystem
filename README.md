# Year4ControlSystem
 
Hello reader,

This project was done in collaboration with students David Moli and Livin Aurélien for the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the context of the master course MATH-H407
Control System Design under the teaching of reknown searcher and professor Emmanuele Garone.

The goal of the project was to control the position of a ball a tube at the base of which a fan connected to a DC motor would blow air to make it go up and down by activating the motor. Different sensors were available and a whole control schema was developped on simulink during 2 intensive months of laboratory sessions to arrive at the final report linked in the report section. Enjoy !
